FILES:
thread		a data structure thats represents a thread.
priorityList	priority queue of thread pointers which uses the priority's colors.
uthreads	the requseted user thread library.
general.h	general includes and defines.
Makefile 	the makefile for the exercise.
README		this file.


ANSWERS:
1.
RR pro & PQ con: approximating the ideal parallel processing by sharing the processor time. in PQ
schedueling is linear so it is far from ideal in general case. 
RR con & PQ pro: mark certain task as more important. (impossible and possible respectedly) 
in our implementation there is possiblity to set priority, on the price that threads might get
starved, but without loosing the very good time sharing approximatation.

2.
A simple case is when a user asks for opening a file. the time to get data from the HDD is
significantly slower than the processor's clock, so the OS will probably block it until it's done.
